# ✈️ Airline Performance Analysis using Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview

This case study focuses on analyzing **Airline Flight Performance** using **Power BI**. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and includes metrics like average delays, flight status (On Time, Delayed, Cancelled), airline names, departure times, and more.

### 🧠 Objective

To build a fully interactive [Power BI dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/links/8VhtR-sO1u?ctid=6c3a6b9e-a1bb-4e39-8899-b86d6898245e&pbi_source=linkShare) that helps answer questions such as:
- How many flights are cancelled or delayed?
- Which airline has the highest average delay?
- What is the trend of delays by weekday, hour, and month?

## 📂 Steps Performed

### 1. Data Preparation
- Loaded airline dataset into Power BI
- Replaced null values in `Avg Delay` with 0 using **Replace Values**
- Applied transformations in Power Query

### 2. Dashboard Page 1 – Airline Performance Overview
- **Slicer**: Filter data by `Month`
- **Clustered Column Chart**: Compare flight status by `Week Day`
- **Slicer**: Filter by `Airline Name`
- **Pie Chart**: Show distribution of On-Time, Delayed, Cancelled flights
- **Bar Chart**: Average Delay per Airline per Year
- **Card**: Display overall average delay

### 3. Dashboard Page 2 – In-Depth Departure Analysis
- **Slicers**: `Airline Name`, `Day of Week`, `Month`
- **Card**: Display most Organic Airport
- **Stacked Column Chart**: Flights count by `Departure Hour`

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Airlines show distinct delay patterns across weekdays and months
- Specific airlines have consistently lower average delays
- Certain hours and days have peak flight activity

---

## 📌 Learnings
- Mastered Power Query Editor for data transformation
- Built multi-layered dashboards using slicers, cards, and charts
- Gained insights from real-world airline operations data
